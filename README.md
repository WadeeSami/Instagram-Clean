# Instagram-Clean
Trying to pour as much knowledge as I can to make this app clean and lean when exposed to new changes. the back end is written in python using Django, DRF and SqlAlchemy.

## Ideas and techniques I am learning about in the current time:
* flow controllers and coordinators
* SnapKit for Programmatic UI
* View Models
* Writting Clean Code
* Dependency Injection
* Alamofire and Moya
